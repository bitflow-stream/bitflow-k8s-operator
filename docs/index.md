TODO Extend and fix Docs, add examples

The Bitflow Kubernetes Operator implements distributed scheduling and chaining of data stream processing containers on Kubernetes.
It uses the Kubernetes Operator pattern to manage stream processing pods based on two custom resource definitions: `BitflowSource` and `BitflowStep`.
